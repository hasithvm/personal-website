<h1 class="entry-title">Hasith Vidanamadura</h1>
<em>is a Canadian software engineer living in the Pacific Northwest. </em>

<p>
I am a SWE at Microsoft working on data science challenges in the Windows product space for the last six years. I graduated from Carleton University in Ottawa (Canada) with a degree in Computer Systems Engineering and briefly worked at Microsoft Vancouver post-graduation. I have called the Pacific Northwest my home since  2015 - on both sides of the border. 
</p>

<p>
Outside of work, I spend my free time on photography, exploring, woodworking, baking, and fishkeeping.
