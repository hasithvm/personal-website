<h1 class="entry-title">Hasith Vidanamadura</h1>
<em>is a Canadian software engineer living in the Puget Sound. </em>

<p>
I graduated from Carleton University in Ottawa a few years ago, and I have called the Pacific Northwest my home ever since then - on both sides of the border. I've been a software engineer at Microsoft working on data science challenges for the last six years. Outside of work, I spend my free time on photography, exploring, woodworking, baking, and fishkeeping.
