Welcome! I'm **Hasith Vidanamadura**, a software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond. I graduated from Carleton University a few years agos, and I have called the Pacific Northwest my home ever since then. I'm trying to blog about my weird hobbies and neat things I stumble into.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasith-vidanamadura-b0a65236/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hasithvm2/) or shoot me an email.
